### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lauren -- a newly-minted SWE previously in biotech R&D.

Check out [JOT](https://github.com/li-lauren/JOT), my full-stack app for news article sharing & discussion.  (There's a short demo video too!)

In addition to React, Flask, PostGreSQL and all that good stuff, I also love working with data (especially data visualization).
Here are a few D3.js data vis projects I've been working on:
[Chicago Public Urination Tickets (Before vs During Covid)](https://github.com/li-lauren/chi_data_vis)
[San Francisco Covid Cases by Race](https://github.com/li-lauren/sf-cov-cases-data-vis-race)
